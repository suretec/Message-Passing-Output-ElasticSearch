    Message::Passing::Output::ElasticSearch - output logstash messages into
    ElasticSearch.

SYNOPSIS
        message-pass --input STDIN --output ElasticSearch --output_options '{"elasticsearch_servers": ["localhost:9200", "192.0.2.29:9200"]}'

DESCRIPTION
    Currently this output stores messages in the logstash format:

    index
        one index per day in the format logstash-YYYY.MM.dd

    type
        Is taken from the '__CLASS__' attribute or set to 'unknown' if not
        defined. If is also stored in the @type field.

    id  Is takes from the 'uuid' attribute or autogenerated by
        ElasticSearch.

    @timestamp
        The datetime is taken from the message epochtime or date attribute.

        The epochtime attribute is expected in seconds since 1.1.1970 00:00
        UTC.

        The date attribute is expected to be a string in ISO8601 format.

        If both are missing the current timestamp is used. It is used to
        determine the index as well as stored in the @timestamp field.

    @tags
        Is set to an empty list.

    @source_host
        Is takes from the message hostname attribute or set to 'none' if not
        defined.

    @message
        Is taken from the 'message' attribute or the whole message gets JSON
        encoded.

    @fields
